# Task
In the file I attached you'll find an HTML5 mockup.
How it should work:
You as a user upload file (anyLogo.png).
After uploading based on user choice in the dropdown menu, move the image tag (<img src="anyLogo.png">) to top Textarea or bottom Textarea. Position it with a style attributes.

P.s > Not mandatory, but if you can, make a mobile preview on the right side.
